			Once upon a <span class="redStyle">time</span>, there lived a family with three sons. 
			Malik was <span class="blueStyle">the</span> youngest boy. 
			He was forever working <span class="blueStyle monoStyle">to</span> prove how strong, brave and wise he was. 
			Following his brothers as <span class="monoStyle redStyle">they</span> plowed the fields and milked the cows and herded sheep. 
			"You can't keep up," his brothers <span class="redStyle monoStyle">teased</span>, but Malik was determined to show them what a grownup he was.
			One day his father called Malik <span class="blueStyle monoStyle">to</span> his side. 
			"We are going to go away to the city to sell our vegetables," he <span class="blueStyle">told</span> his son. 
			His brothers will be <span class="redStyle monoStyle">going</span> with farther.
			He needs to <span class="blueStyle monoStyle">stay</span> at home.
			Help his mother care for the <span class="blueStyle">cows</span> and the sheep and the garden.
